The Memory Bar is an RPG, Light platform Jumping Game(similar to Kirby & The Amazing Mirror 星のカービィ鏡の大迷宮), which is design for Platform Jumping Game lovers and Casual game lovers. The game begins with the Player character entering a bar called "The Memory Bar", and the character feels curious about the name of the bar, he/she doesn't know what kind of memories are sealed in this bar. To help the character find out the answer, the publican of the bar gives the player the first glass of drink, after some drinking, the player gets drunk and falls into the first stage of the game (the forcing novice guide). After the first stage, the players will know that drinking different kinds of drinks will lead he/she into different stages, and the players must collect the tokens in the stages and give them to the publican.

First of all, because Chuansong likes to go to bars, he enjoys communicating with bartenders in bars, he likes to learn other people's stories, he gets a lot of inspiration from everyone's stories, and he wants to show everyone these things.
In terms of game ideas, Star Kirby-Amazing Mirror gave us a lot of inspiration, and we believe it can help us show our story.
<ul><strong>Project Objectives/Goals</strong></ul>
1.	At least complete 3 game demo<br/>
2.	Upload game to the STEAM<br/>
3.	We chose 2D because it is an interesting form, and we want to express the feeling of time returning in this way. And most of the early games were also 2D, we believe this can express what we want.<br/>
4.	RPG Platform is going to be used in this game. It is a good narrative method. We can add some background stories to help players bring their emotions into this mode. And some settings in the operation can make the game more suitable for the story we want to express.<br/>
5.	Players will play the game on the PC side, and the launch of the mobile terminal has not yet been considered. Because we insist that the PC side can have a better display.<br/>
6.	We want players to see the story we want to show them. At the same time, we hope that players will be willing to accept everything they have experienced after experiencing our game and will not regret the time wasted due to some things or should not know someone in the future. Because we feel that every story and experience will make you who you are now, and what we must do is to recognize the essence of life and still love their life.<br/>
